<h2>Set environment variables using the OpenStack RC file</h2>

<p>To set the required environment variables for the OpenStack command-line clients, you must create an environment file
called an OpenStack rc file, or <code class="filename">openrc.sh</code> file. This project-specific environment
file contains the credentials that all OpenStack services use.</p>

<p>When you source the file, environment variables are set for your current shell. The variables enable the OpenStack client
commands to communicate with the OpenStack services that run in the cloud.</p>

<h2>source your openrc file in a fixed form: source openrc [username] [projectname]</h2>
